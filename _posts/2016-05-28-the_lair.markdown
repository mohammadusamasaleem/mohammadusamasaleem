    <a target="_blank" href="http://pachterlab.github.io/lair/">The Lair</a> is a website
    that hosts interactive reanalyses of publicly available RNA-seq data. The
    analyses are automatically run by a back-end Snakemake buildsystem and
    performed by kallisto and sleuth. This work was published in
    <a target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12859-016-1357-2"> an article
    in BMC Bioinformatics</a>.
    The website promotes verifiability of RNA-seq experiements.

Reproducibility is critical to experimental results. To this end, many
RNA-seq papers archive their data in the Sequence Read Archive. This data is theoretically
enough to reproduce the results of the original paper; doing so is intractable
due to the computational power required to process the results and the computational
biology background needed to select the right computational tools.

[The Lair][lair] is a system and website that the [Pachter Lab][lab] and I made to address this problem:
It hosts interactive re-analyses of publicly available RNA-seq data.
The development of this system work was published in
[an article in BMC Bioinformatics][pub].

The reason the Lair is so powerful is that the re-analyses of papers are performed automatically
by a back-end [Snakemake][snake] build-system that uses [kallisto][kallisto] and [sleuth][sleuth].
The website allows anyone to inspect the results of RNA-seq experiments without
needing computing power or extensive knowledge of alignment/analysis tools.

You can take a look at the [Lair repo][repo]
to see the source for the website. I designed the website, as well as
the majority of the back-end system behind it.

The workflow of the back-end system is diagramed below:
