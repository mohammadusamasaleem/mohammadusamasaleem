description: >
    Concurrent open shop scheduling is an NP-hard problem that has applications
    in industrial manufacturing and cloud computing. My research group and I
    improved the best-known approximation algorithms for the problem, and
    tested our algorithms on both randomized data and data from Facebook
    trace.
background: >
    Concurrent open shop is a problem in scheduling theory. It is relevant to
    grid computing and cloud computing, as well as industrial manufacturing.
    Due to its close relationship with the co-flow problem, it is relevant
    to distributed computing frameworks like MapReduce. <br /><br />

    The formal description of the problem is as follows:
    You are given M machines and N jobs. Each job j has a non-negative
    processing time pij on machine i, 1 <= j <= N, 1 <= i <= M.
    Each job also has a weight wj. Job j's completion time Cj is defined as the
    time at which all processing requirements of job j have been met.
    The objective is to minimize sum(wj*Cj), the sum of weighted completion
    times of the jobs.<br /><br />

    There are several variants on the problem. One variant is concurrent
    open shop with release times: each job also has a non-negative release time
    rj. No part of job j can be processed before its release time.<br /><br />

    The variant considered here is the online version of concurrent open shop:
    as opposed to knowing each job in advance, jobs arrive over time, and the
    details of each job become known once they arrive.<br /><br />

    The problem is described in more detail by the paper

my_role: >
    I developed a 10-approximation algorithm for the online concurrent
    open shop problem, from the previously best-known 16-approximation algorithm.
    My results were sufficiently general to extend to other scheduling environments,
    and I used this to develop a 12-approximation algorithm for the online
    coflow problem â€“ the first online coflow approximation algorithm. <br /><br />

    I also analyzed my new algorithm against several other heuristics, including
    a simple greedy algorithm, to show that the new algorithm does well in practice.

As part of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/reucaar/index.html">REU CAAR</a>
program at the University of Maryland, I worked with three other undergraduate students
to improve the best-known algorithm for concurrent open shop. We successfully
did so in the online setting, and are currently working on a manuscript containing
our results. <br /><br />

We developed a more general framework for online scheduling algorithms, which
we used not only for concurrent open shop but also for the coflow scheduling problem,
for which we developed the first online algorithms. These results, along
with our experimental analysis, are still in progress, and are expected to be
in the arXiv by January 2017. <br /><br />

We were supervised by Samir Khuller, the department chair of the CS department.
