    Sleuth is an RNA-seq tool that analyzes quantified reads from
    <a href="https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto">Kallisto</a>
    and can display the analysis in a web browser using
    <a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com">Shiny by RStudio</a>.
    It uses Kallisto's bootstrap estimates to implement novel statistical
    methods for differential analysis. It was developed by the
    <a href="http://pachterlab.github.io">Pachter Lab</a> at UC Berkeley.
background: >
    RNA-Sequencing, or RNA-seq for short, was developed in 2008 and is a
    type of study that aims, at a high level, to understand gene expression
    within an organism. RNA-seq is used to analyze the transcriptome,
    which, unlike the genome, is constantly changing. Among other things, RNA-seq
    helps us understand what types of conditions can cause cells to express
    certain genes (differential analysis), and helps us discover new
    transcripts and explore their purpose.<br /> <br />

    In an RNA-seq experiment, RNA from an organism is chemically prepared and
    fed through a sequencer. The sequencer generates "reads" in the millions:
    each read is a chunk of RNA-molecule that came from the original organism.
    A computer program, such as <a href="https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto">Kallisto</a>,
    is then used to find which genes these reads came from. This process is called
    loosely called "alignment." The more reads that mapped to a particular gene,
    the more that gene was being expressed at the time of the sequencing.
    Due to the sheer volume of data, there are many difficult computational
    problems involved with RNA-seq alignment, many of which are discussed in the
    <a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v34/n5/full/nbt.3519.html">Kallisto Paper</a>.
    <br /><br />

    After the reads have been aligned, another computer program, such as
    <a href="http://pachterlab.github.io/sleuth/">Sleuth</a>, is used to
    determine, statistically speaking, which genes were most
    <i>differentially expressed</i> across a condition. Whether or not a gene
    was significantly different across a condition is typically determined by
    p-value or q-value.

Sleuth is an RNA-seq tool that analyzes quantified reads from
<a href="https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto">Kallisto</a>.
Sleuth is novel both in its use of statistical bootstraps to understand
differential gene expression, and in its use of
<a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com">Shiny</a> to provide in-browser, interactive
analyses of RNA-seq experiments.
It was developed by the <a href="http://pachterlab.github.io">Pachter Lab</a>
at UC Berkeley. More about Sleuth can be found at the
<a href="http://pachterlab.github.io/sleuth/">Sleuth homepage</a>. The
source code for sleuth is available on Github at the
