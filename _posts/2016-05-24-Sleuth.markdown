    Sleuth is an RNA-seq tool to perform differential expression analysis of quantified reads from
    kallisto
    and can display the analysis in a web browser using
    Shiny by RStudio.
    It uses kallisto's bootstrap estimates to implement novel statistical
    methods for differential analysis.

Sleuth is an `RNA-seq` tool that performs differential expression analysis on quantified reads from
[kallisto][kallisto].
Sleuth is novel both in its use of statistical bootstraps to understand
differential gene expression, and in its use of
[Shiny][shiny] to provide in-browser, interactive
analyses of RNA-seq experiments.
If you are interested in using sleuth, see the
[sleuth homepage][sleuth]
If you would like to see an example of a live sleuth analysis, see
[the Lair][lair].

RNA-Sequencing, or `RNA-seq` for short, is a
type of study that aims, at a high level, to understand gene expression
within an organism. `RNA-seq` is used to analyze the `transcriptome`: the parts
of the genome that are being expressed by each cell. Unlike the genome,
the `transcriptome` is constantly changing and varies depending on which cell you look at.

RNA-seq helps us understand how environmental factors impact our `transcriptome`.
A better understanding of our `transcriptome` may help us develop cures or treatments for diseases and medical conditions
that currently have no tractable cure.

My role in this project was twofold: I designed several of the data
visualizations present in the Sleuth live app, and I made it possible for high-volume Sleuth objects to be shared online.

Sleuth was developed by the [Pachter Lab][lab]
at UC Berkeley.
