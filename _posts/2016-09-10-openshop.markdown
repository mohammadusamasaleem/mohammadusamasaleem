description: >
    Concurrent open shop scheduling is an NP-hard problem that has applications
    in industrial manufacturing and cloud computing. My research group and I
    improved the best-known approximation algorithms for the problem, and
    tested our algorithms on both randomized data and data from Facebook
    trace.

[Scheduling problems][schedule] are a type of problem in which we are given a set of machines
and a set of jobs; we have to specify a schedule for the machines to perform the jobs
such that the jobs are completed in the most efficient manner [[^1]].

As part of the [REU CAAR][car]
program at the University of Maryland, I worked with three other undergraduate students
to improve the best-known algorithm for concurrent open shop, which is a type of scheduling problem.
We successfully did so in the online setting, and have submitted a manuscript containing our results.

We developed a more general framework for online scheduling algorithms, which
we used not only for concurrent open shop but also coflow scheduling and
unrelated parallel machine scheduling, for which we developed the best-known algorithms to date.

We were supervised by Samir Khuller, the department chair of the CS department.

We presented the following poster of our work at a symposium hosted by the National Science Foundation.

[^1]: What "efficient" means depends on the problem. In our work, our objective was to minimize the sum of weighted completion times.
