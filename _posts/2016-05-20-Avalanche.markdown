    Avalanche was an old flash game in which you played as a marshmallow and
    jumped on falling blocks while avoiding the rising lava. I'm remaking the game for
    the iPhone using SpriteKit as my game framework, and using GameKit to track user
    scores and achievements.

Avalanche is a top-scrolling iPhone game. You play as a marshmallow and try to
avoid the rising lava by climbing on the blocks falling from the ceiling. You have to avoid
getting crushed by a falling block as well. Feel free to check out the [Avalanche Repo][repo] for
the source code, and to check my progress.

The game is developed in SpriteKit. The phyiscs is handled by SKPhysics, and the
explosions are created using SKEmitterNodes. The sprites are all drawn in Adobe
Illustrator.
