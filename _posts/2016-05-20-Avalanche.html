    Avalanche was an old flash game in which you played as a marshmallow and
    jumped on falling blocks while avoiding the rising lava. I'm remaking the game for
    the iPhone with SpriteKit as my main game framework. I plan on adding new features
    and connecting it to Apple's Game Center to track high scores.

    I've always thought about remaking it for the iPhone,
    but never got around to it until 2016.

    Everything! This is a solo project. I even did the sprites,
    although my ability to draw sprites is relatively mediocre.

Avalanche is a top-scrolling iPhone game. You play as a marshmallow and try to
avoid the rising lava by climbing on the blocks falling from the ceiling. You have to avoid
getting crushed by a falling block as well.
The Github repo for the project is here: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/psturmfels/Avalanche"><span class="icon icon--github">
{% include icon-github.svg %}</span><span class="username">Avalanche</span></a>.
This project is in-progress; I expect to be finished by the end of
August 2016.
<br /><br />

The marshmallow you play as is featured both in the footer of my webpage, and the homepage.
<br /><br />

The game is developed in SpriteKit. The phyiscs is handled by SKPhysics, and the
explosions are created using SKEmitterNodes. The sprites are all drawn in Adobe
Illustrator. <br /> <br />
