    Anonymouse is a peer-to-peer microblogging app for the iPhone. It is designed
    to provide local and anonymous communication that is censorship and
    network-blogging resistant – it does so by leveraging an ad-hoc network
    implemented with the Multipeer Connectivity framework built into the iPhone.

background: >
    The idea behind this app comes from
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.davidbild.org/publications/bild14apr.pdf">David Bild's Thesis</a>;
    David Bild was a graduate student at the University of Michigan who's advisor,
    <a target="_blank" href="http://robertdick.org">Robert Dick</a>, is Anonymouse's faculty
    sponsor. The central idea was to provide people with a way to communicate,
    even if another party was attempting to block their communication.
    The spread rate of a messages in a delay-tolerant ad-hoc network, even
    when parts of that network are being blocked, is discussed in the the thesis above.
    <br /><br />

    The essential idea of the app is this: since all phones are Wi-Fi
    emitters and receivers, why do they need a middle man (e.g a cell provided)
    to communicate with each other? The problem is that a phones emitting range is
    quite limited, to ~100 meters, and it would be somewhat useless if you could
    only communicate with people in a 100-meter range. But what if, by
    "bouncing" messages across intermediate senders, you could extend the range
    of your own communication? A delay tolerant network treats everyone in the network
    as a potential node to send and receive messages – as long as the network is dense
    enough, messages will always be able to find a path between any two people.
    <br /><br />

    Our app uses the above concept to spread mesages without cellular service.
    Since the network does not rely on chokepoints which are easily controlled or
    blocked by authorities, it also is censorship resistant.


my_role: >
    I was the primary iOS developer for this app. I designed the communications protocol
    for the app – that is, I designed how many nearby phones communicate with each other
    to maximize the spread of messages. The specifics of the protocol can be found on
    our Github page, but essentially it utilizes a hashing algorithm to determine
    which phones to communicate to, and a prioritizing algorithm
    to determine which messages to send first. More information about the
    algorithms behind the app can be found in the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://1am-networks.org/documents.html">publications tab</a> of
    the Anonymouse website.

Anonymouse is a peer-to-peer microblogging app for the iPhone. It is designed
to provide local and anonymous communication that is censorship and
network-blogging resistant – it does so by leveraging an ad-hoc network
implemented with the Multipeer Connectivity framework built into the iPhone.
Since it leverages peer-to-peer wifi, the app can communicate other, nearby phones
<i>without wifi, cellular service,
or any infrastructure networks</i>.
You can check out the

for the source code.
<br /><br />

The app has two main purposes. Its first purpose is as a local social-media
app that works without network service. Its second purpose is to serve as a way to
spread delay-tolerant messages in places where networks are being blocked or censored,
or where natural disasters have wiped out infrastructure network towers.

This app is an ongoing project – it is scheduled to release in December 2016 -
and is sponsored by the University of Michigan's
