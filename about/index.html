    My name is Pascal Sturmfels, and I'm an undergraduate studying computer science
    and mathematics at the University of Michigan. My areas of research include
    computational biology, mobile communications technology, and graph theory.
    <br /> <br />

    Outside of academics, I enjoy <a href="https://youtu.be/w8CNzMP0JH8" target="_blank">playing the piano</a>,

    folding origami</a>, running and reading. I also develop iPhone games.

    <br /> <br />
    At Michigan, I'm on the executive board of the professional technology fraternity
    <a target="_blank" href="http://kappathetapi.com">Kappa Theta Pi</a>. I manage
    all of our technological projects, including giving tech-talks and rebuilding
    our defunct website (I am aware of the sorry state of our current one).
